# üìú Contract Review & Compliance Automation  
Welcome to my **Multi-Agent Legal AI Project**! This repository demonstrates how to leverage **LLMs, LangChain, and Streamlit** to automatically review contracts for compliance risks, highlight problematic clauses, and provide summaries in real time.  

- ü§ñ Multi-Agent workflow using **LangChain + Ollama**  
- üìë Upload PDF contracts directly from the app  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Clause extraction, risk detection, and compliance flagging  
- üîç Highlighted risk visualization with structured summaries  
- üåê Deployed with **Streamlit** for an interactive demo

     - Highlights vague terms  
     - Flags high-risk obligations  
     - Maps risks to potential regulatory issues  

3. **Summarization Agent**  
   - **Model**: `llama3.2:1b`
